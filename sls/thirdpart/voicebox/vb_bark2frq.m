function f = vb_bark2frq(b)
%vb_bark2frq  Convert the BARK frequency scale to Hertz FRQ=(BARK)
%       frq = vb_bark2frq(bark) converts a vector of frequencies (in BARK)
%       to the corresponding values in Hertz.

%   There are many published formulae approximating the Bark scale.
%   We use the one from Traunmuller.
